# Those Who Have Been Brought Back
A single-player video game project created as part of the Video Games course during my master's degree
-  

The Spirit wakes up in a strange, unknown place. All around them is only darkness, dampness and a musty smell. The Spirit tries to move their hand — it turns out that they have neither a hand, nor any body part at all. 
The Spirit thinks, “I need to get out of here,” and suddenly, they are no longer surrounded by a cool darkness, but by a pleasant breeze and the rays of the setting sun. 
In front of them stands a tombstone, although the Spirit is unable to decipher the inscription on it. However, they have a strange feeling that those incomprehensible letters once represented their name. 
They look around and see no one, only a charming little cemetery. Suddenly, a voice resonates behind them, seemingly coming from afar: “You are dead.” 
The Spirit turns around but sees no one, but the voice continues: “Remember your name and perhaps you will be able to return.”

The player embodies the Spirit, who believes that a return to the world of the living is possible, but only if they remember their name. The only problem is that they cannot read the inscription on their tombstone. 
However, they are in no ordinary cemetery — the area is filled with many mysteries and secrets, guarded by mysterious guardians. Other spirits float in contemplation near the other tombstones. 
If any place is a magical cemetery where spirits return to the world of the living, this is it. 

The main branch contains the project documentation. The game code is located in the unity_app branch. The game was developed using the Unity engine.
